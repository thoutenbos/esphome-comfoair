# Zehnder WHR 950 ESPHOME - RS485 Edition
Port of ComfoAir protocol to ESPHome.io firmware originally by @wichers modified by @nyxnyx
to be installed as external_components. Modified for the Zehnder WHR 950 by @tieskuh.
With some cheap hardware found below, you can connect your Zehnder to HomeAssistant.

# RS485 Edition
This fork was modified to work with the first gen RS485 protocol for Zehnder WHR / ComfoAir CA-500
It is still a WIP so usage is fully at own risk.

# Configuration
Look at comfoair.yaml
